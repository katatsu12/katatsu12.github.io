Feliz Navidad Sedona, located in Tlaquepaque arts and crafts village, specializes in handmade Christmas decorations from all over the world. Inspired by the beautiful desert surroundings here in Arizona we carry a large selection of ornaments made by our own southwest artisans. For collectors, we carry a variety of traditional German wood creations from the Erzgebirge region. We carry nativity sets from around the world, including hand carved Russian pieces, carved olive wood from the holy land, and Venezuelan, Bolivian, Chilean, and Peruvian ceramic sets.
