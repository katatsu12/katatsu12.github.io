Visiting our wonderful shop you will see beautiful treasures of the earth from around the world, including Ancient Fossils, Exotic Butterflies, Precious Gems & Minerals and an array of unique and special gifts for everyone. The shop is part museum, part gallery and there is plenty to fascinate and engage kids, who especially love the meteorites. Museum-quality crystals, beautifully handcrafted jewelry and wall art pieces are all part of the discovery experience within our brightly lit shop.
