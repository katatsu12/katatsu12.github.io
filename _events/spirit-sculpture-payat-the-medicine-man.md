<div>Quilts Ltd Gallery Presents "Spirit Sculpture", Original Art One-of-a-kind fiber sculptures by Gretchen Wood, Arizona fiber artist. Her work is not only an expression of what she sees, but what she feels. She creates the message and gives a voice to the Spirit inside who has patiently waited to be heard. These messages can be felt through her fiber sculptures.</div>
