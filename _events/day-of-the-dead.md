Our Día de los Muertos celebration honors that vision.<br><br>Experience the Festival:<br></p><ul><li>Stunning altars and large-scale cultural installations throughout the village</li><li>Traditional offerings (ofrendas), colorful cut-paper banners (papel picado), and handcrafted figurines (la calaca)</li><li>Live music, traditional dance performances, and roving entertainment</li></ul>
