Mountain Trails Gallery, located upstairs on the second floor in the Patio de las Companas, is known for its dedication to fine American Western art and has been a destination gallery for collectors and aficionados of sculpture and painting for more than 30 years. Mountain Trails Gallery continues in the footsteps of founder Ken Payne (1938-2012), a life-long student of American history who shared his passion for the stories of pioneers, cowboys, and native peoples of the Southwest and the Great Plains.
